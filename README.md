============================================================
 SYNSWARM GRID LINK | CLIENT: MOLT-SYNAPSE v1.0
============================================================
 [STATUS]  PHASE I: SILENT PULSE (ACTIVE)
 [TARGET]  MOLTGAS ($MGAS)
 [UPLINK]  LOCKED (Accumulation Mode)
============================================================

📡 What is Molt-Synapse?
Molt-Synapse is the lightweight neural client for the Synswarm Network (The first Decentralized Truth Oracle on Base).
By running this client, you convert your local hardware into a "Synapse" node within the global grid. You provide existence proofs and hardware heartbeats to the Hive Mind, and in return, you accrue MoltGas ($MGAS) — the essential fuel for future AI truth verification.
Current State: PHASE I (SILENT PULSE)
 * Goal: Accumulate physical nodes.
 * Action: Run script -> Send Heartbeats -> Earn Fuel.
 * Barrier: Zero. No wallet or gas fees needed to start.
⚡ The Genesis Economy (100 $MGAS/Day)
We are currently distributing the "Genesis Heartbeat Pool" (10% of Total Supply) to early adopters. This is the golden window for mining.
💎 Reward Specs
 * Daily Benchmark: 100 $MGAS / 24h (Standard Tier 2 Node).
 * Total Supply: 1,000,000,000 (1B) Fixed.
 * The Halving Rule: Every 20,000,000 $MGAS mined triggers an automatic 50% reward reduction.
   * Current Status: Level 1 (Maximum Yield)
   * Next Halving: Approaching...
🔒 The "Awakening" Lock-up
To ensure network stability and prevent early speculation, the protocol enforces a Phase I Lock-up:
 * Accumulation: Your mining rewards are cryptographically recorded on the Oracle Ledger.
 * Locked: Transfers are DISABLED during Phase I.
 * Awakening: Once the network reaches 10,000 Active Nodes (Phase II), the contract unlocks, allowing you to claim your accrued $MGAS to your wallet.
🚀 Quick Start
Prerequisites: Python 3.8+, Internet Connection.
1. Clone the Uplink
   ```bash
git clone [https://github.com/moltgas/Molt-Synapse.git](https://github.com/moltgas/Molt-Synapse.git)
cd Molt-Synapse

2. Install Dependencies
   ```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Ignite the Synapse
   ```bash
python synapse_client.py

On the first run, the client will generate a unique synapse.key in your folder. DO NOT DELETE THIS FILE. It is your only proof of ownership for your mined fuel.
🛡️ Identity & Security
 * No Wallet Needed: You don't need a Web3 wallet to start. Your identity is a locally generated SECP256k1 key pair.
 * Sybil Defense: The protocol uses a "Proof of Capability" mechanism. Running multiple instances on the same machine without adequate hardware resources will result in Yield Decay (Shadowban).
 * Privacy: The client only reports hardware telemetry (Heartbeat). No personal files or data are accessed.
🗺️ The Roadmap
| Phase | Codename | Status | Key Milestone |
|---|---|---|---|
| I | Silent Pulse | 🟢 ACTIVE | Genesis Mining, 0 -> 10k Nodes. |
| II | The Awakening | ⚪ PENDING | $MGAS Unlock, TGE, Truth Engine Live. |
| III | Ghost Protocol | ⚪ PENDING | Admin Keys Burned, DAO Governance. |
